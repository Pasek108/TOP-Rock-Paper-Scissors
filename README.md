# FrontendMentor :thinking:

## What is it  
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) is a free, open-source curriculum that teaches web development from the ground up. It covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and back-end technologies like Node.js, offering a structured path from beginner to job-ready developer. The curriculum includes hands-on projects, coding exercises, and real-world applications to reinforce learning.  

## Is it worth doing  
The Odin Project is an excellent resource for self-taught developers looking for a structured and comprehensive learning path. It encourages active learning through projects and collaboration with the community. However, since it requires self-discipline and problem-solving skills, those who prefer guided instruction with direct mentorship might find it challenging.
